AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks. 

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i citron` or `appman -i citron`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install citron.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install citron`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)

## Known variance

- Working directory in Workspace is the temporary AppImage one, instead of `$HOME`.  
That is because we are patching the main binary to look into AppImage's `share` folder instead of the host's `/usr/share/`, which is required for locale/languages to work.  
To workaround this issue, you can just create a new workspace with correct directory and delete the old one.
